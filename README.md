JSWebConsole
============

A JavaScript web console.

Users can type JavaScript into a form in their web browser, execute it, and see
the results. The code is executed in a sandbox, so there should be no security
risks.

JavaScript editing and code styling is provided by the Ace code editor:

Currently, the only theme that is supported is Monokai, but this may change.
